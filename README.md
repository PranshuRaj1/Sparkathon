# Dukaan Payouts UI - Frontend Engineer Assignment

## Overview
This project is my submission for the Dukaan Frontend Engineer assignment. It involves coding a Figma design in React with pixel perfection, utilizing the Vite build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Technologies Used
- Vite + React
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PranabKumarSahoo/dukaan-payouts-ui-assignment.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
